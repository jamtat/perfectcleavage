The Variscan ceases, allowing the region to relax, and reacts with N-S oriented extension. This gives opportunity for the Whin Sill to intrude across northern England with the input of mineralising fluids, forming the North Pennine ore field.
The Variscan Orogeny inverts extensional faults, constricting the area.
Early Carboniferous extension opens up sedimentary basins across the region.
The Caledonian Orogeny forms sinistral transpressional faults due to pre-existing ENE structures. The Weardale Granite intrudes the slates.
Mud and silt is deposited to be metamorphosed into slate, forming the Skiddaw Slate Group.
