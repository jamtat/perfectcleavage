abundance: 	'Widely distributed occurring in veins either alone or as a gangue mineral with metallic ores.'
hardness: 	'4 (Medium)'
lustre: 	'Vitreous'
ore: 		'None'
fact: 		'Many samples exhibit fluorescence under ultraviolet light - a property that takes its name from fluorite.'
uses: 		[
				'Metallurgical grade fluorite (60-85% CaF2) used as a flux to lower the melting point in steel production and to decrease the viscosity of slags. Later used in the production of aluminium to remove impurities.'
				'Ceramic grade fluorite (85-95% CaF2) used in the production of opalescent glass, enamels and cooking utensils.'
				'Acid grade fluorite (>95%) used to make hydrogen fluoride and hydrofluoric acid - accounts for 95% of fluorite consumption in the USA.'
