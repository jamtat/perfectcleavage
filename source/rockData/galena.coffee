name:		'Galena'
formula:	'PbS'
colour: 	[
				'Lead-grey'
			]
abundance: 	'Galena is found worldwide in a variety of different geologic environments due to its formation in low, intermediate and high temperature environments.'
hardness: 	'2.5 (soft)'
lustre: 	'Metallic, however specimens tarnish when exposed to air becoming dull.'
ore: 		'Most abundant lead ore.'
fact: 		'The smelting of Galena can be achieved by nothing more complex than heating galena in the embers of a campfire and retrieving the metal from beneath when it cools.'
uses: 		[
				'In ancient times lead was widely used for everything from water pipes to cooking pots, however due to our knowledge of its toxic and carcinogenic properties, its applications have been limited. Lead still has many uses in the modern world, from car batteries to the lining of roofs.'
			]
extractors: [
				'Galena is a fairly common mineral and occurs in numerous locations worldwide. Galena is mined in Germany, Kosovo, Romania , and the U.S. tri-state mining district of Kansas, Missouri and Oklahoma.'
			]
chabit: 	[
				'Fully grown crystals can be either coarse or fine grained and more rarely fibrous, crystals exceeding 2.5cm are common.'
			]
cstruct: 	'Cubic and octahedral crystal systems, although the latter is rarely present alone. These crystals often grow on top of one another.'
depenv:		[
				'Sedimentary limestone deposits'
				'Hydrothermal veins'
				'Hydrothermal replacement deposits'
				'Placer deposits. Rarely associated with basalts and diabase.'
			]
tparency: 	'Opaque'
origin:		'Named by Pliny the Elder in 77-79 from the Greek "galene" meaning lead ore.'
observed: 	[
				'Lead-grey'
			]
usesplus: 	[
				'One of its oldest known uses was in Ancient Egypt where Egyptians would smear galena around their eyes to reflect sunlight and repel disease carrying insects. In many cases, galena contains impurities such as Copper, Zinc, Bismuth and Silver.'
				'Often Galena can be made up of 1-2% silver, and this can be of greater value than the lead content making it also an important source of silver.'
			]
streak: 	'Lead-grey'
cleavage: 	'Often exhibits a perfect cubic cleavage with abundant triangular pits. This results in it deforming along itâ€™s cube planes.'
fracture: 	'Subconchoidal'
gravity: 	'7.4 - 7.6 (Very high density)'
properties: [
				'Galena belongs to the octahedral sulfide group of minerals with metal ions in octahedral positions - 6 points, creating 8 faces.'
				'Within the weathering or oxidation zone galena alters to anglesite (lead sulfate), cerussite (lead carbonate), pyromorphite and pseudomorphs, which include chalcocite and covellite and can create overgrowths on one another.'
				'The ratios of lead isotopes (206Pb, 207Pb and 208Pb) in Galena specimens allows the ages of the rock it is found in to be calculated.'
				'Galena often forms along side other minerals, in particular baryte, fluorite, quartz and calcite.'

relevance: 	'Excellent Galena occurs in several places in England; the best include Alston Moor and Weardale, where it forms together with Fluorite.'
opprop: 	'Optically isotropic, it reflects 42% of all light exposed to its surface.'
impurities:	'Can include many different impurities including silver, arsenic, antimony, and copper.'
