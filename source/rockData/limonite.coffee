name:		'Limonite'
formula:	'FeO.OH.nH_2O'
colour: 	[
				'Yellow'
				'Brown'
			]
abundance: 	'Extremely common.'
hardness: 	'4 - 5.5 (Medium)'
lustre: 	'Earthy'
ore: 		'Iron'
fact: 		'Although originally defined as a single mineral, no longer scientifically considered a true mineral as it lacks a definitive chemical formula and crystal structure.  Formula found to be a mixture of different minerals. Limonite is now considered a field term to describe hydrated oxides of iron with poorly crystalline character whose identity has not yet been determined.'
uses: 		[
				'One of two primary iron ores (along side Hematite).'
			]
extractors: [
				'USA (since ceased)'
				'Spain'
				'Brazil'
				'Australia'
			]
chabit: 	[
				'Fine grained aggregate.'
			]
cstruct: 	'Amorphous'
depenv:		[
				'Common as a biogenic precipitate in swamps or as microscopic particles staining other minerals in weathered outcrops of metalliferous veins.'
			]
tparency: 	'Opaque'
origin:		'Named from the Greek word λειμών, meaning meadow, in allusion to its occurrence as a bog iron ore.'
observed: 	[
				'Brown'
				'Orange/brown'
			]
usesplus: 	[
				'As a pigment.'
			]
streak: 	'Yellowish brown'
cleavage: 	'Absent'
fracture: 	'Uneven'
gravity: 	'2.7 - 4.3'
properties: [
				'Commonly a product of iron-bearing minerals but can be found in all rocks.'
				'Mixture of related hydrated iron oxide minerals, chief mineralogical component is goethite. Individual minerals in limonite may form crystals but limonite does not, although it may show a fibrous or microcrystalline structure.'
				'Limonite pseudomorphs can form through chemical weathering, transforming crystals of iron oxides, in particular pyrite, into limonite by hydrating the molecules, although the external shape remains that of the original mineral.'
			]
relevance: 	'Occurs as pseudomorphs of iron oxides in the North Pennine orefield.'
opprop: 	'Normally isotropic but may allow anomalous birefringence.'
impurities:	'None'
